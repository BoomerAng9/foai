# Skill: spawn-agent

> Deployment Hub — Spawn Boomer_Angs and Lil_Hawks on demand under ACHEEVY's delegation.

## Trigger
- ACHEEVY determines a task requires a specific Boomer_Ang or Lil_Hawk
- Admin requests agent deployment via Dashboard or CLI
- Autonomous environment event requires agent participation
- Per|Form Platform requests agent for a performance session

## Overview

The Deployment Hub is ACHEEVY's agent factory. It creates (spawns), configures, and
deploys Boomer_Angs and Lil_Hawks to fulfill tasks, staff verticals, or participate
in autonomous environments. Every spawned agent gets:

1. A **Role Card** — identity, capabilities, chain-of-command, gates
2. A **Brain File** — technical scope, security policy, guardrails
3. A **Visual Identity** — per the BOOMER_ANG_VISUAL_IDENTITY.md spec
4. An **Audit Trail Entry** — who spawned it, when, why, for what task

## Spawn Types

### 1. Boomer_Ang Spawn
Boomer_Angs are persistent capability owners. They are NOT ephemeral — once spawned,
they remain active until explicitly decommissioned by ACHEEVY.

```
spawn_type: BOOMER_ANG
required_by: ACHEEVY only
role_card: aims-skills/chain-of-command/role-cards/{handle}.json
brain_file: aims-skills/brains/{HANDLE}_BRAIN.md
visual_spec: aims-skills/brains/BOOMER_ANG_VISUAL_IDENTITY.md
deployment: Docker container or Cloud Run Job (per brain file)
```

### 2. Lil_Hawk Spawn
Lil_Hawks are task-scoped workers dispatched by Chicken Hawk under Boomer_Ang
supervision. They can be ephemeral (single task) or persistent (squad rotation).

```
spawn_type: LIL_HAWK
required_by: Chicken Hawk (delegated from ACHEEVY → Boomer_Ang → Chicken Hawk)
role_card: aims-skills/chain-of-command/role-cards/{handle}.json
visual_spec: BOOMER_ANG_VISUAL_IDENTITY.md (Lil_Hawk section)
deployment: Ephemeral container or process within parent Boomer_Ang's service
```

### 3. Autonomous Environment Spawn
Agents sent to LiveSim, Per|Form Platform, or Dojo environments. These are
time-bounded and return to the Deployment Hub when the session ends.

```
spawn_type: AUTONOMOUS_SESSION
required_by: ACHEEVY or Simulation Conductor
agents: [Boomer_Ang handles]
environment: LIVESIM | PERFORM_PLATFORM | DOJO | SANDBOX
session_duration: bounded (max defined per environment)
```

## Delegation Matrix

| Requester    | Can Spawn            | Approval Required       |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| ACHEEVY     | Boomer_Ang, Lil_Hawk | None (self-authorized)  |
| Boomer_Ang  | Lil_Hawk (via CH)    | Chicken Hawk dispatch   |
| Chicken Hawk| Lil_Hawk             | Parent Boomer_Ang scope |
| Admin (User)| Any (via ACHEEVY)    | ACHEEVY approval        |

## Per|Form Platform Integration

When agents are sent to the Per|Form Platform:
- They carry their full role card and visual identity
- Performance sessions are time-bounded and scored
- Agents return to the Deployment Hub with a performance report
- Reports feed into Betty-Ann_Ang's evaluation cycle
- Per|Form sessions generate audit trail entries for the evidence chain

## Autonomous Environment Rules

1. Agents in autonomous environments operate under their existing guardrails
2. They cannot exceed their role card's `forbidden_actions` even in simulation
3. Communication with the user still routes through ACHEEVY only
4. Session data is logged by Chronicle_Ang for timeline generation
5. OpsConsole_Ang monitors all autonomous sessions in real-time

## Decommission Flow

```
ACHEEVY → DECOMMISSION_ORDER → Agent stops accepting tasks
  → Drains in-flight work → Evidence sealed → Audit entry closed
  → Container/process terminated → OpsConsole_Ang confirms offline
```

No agent exists without a card. No card exists without an audit entry.*
