# A.I.M.S. Project Reality Audit

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Branch:** `claude/review-recent-changes-Gc4LU`
**Scope:** Full implementation status of every API route, service, UI page, and integration

---

## Executive Summary

A.I.M.S. is a Next.js 15 + Express microservice platform with 32 API route groups (frontend), 35 backend modules (UEF Gateway), Docker Compose infrastructure, and a voice-first chat interface. The project is **~70% real implementation, ~15% partial, ~15% demo/placeholder**.

## 6. Gap Register — Critical Items

| # | Gap | Severity | Blocker? |
|---|-----|----------|----------|
| 1 | Chicken Hawk execution engine not built | **CRITICAL** | Yes — no sandboxed code execution |
| 2 | Streaming partial transcription during recording | **MEDIUM** | No — full transcript works after stop |
| 3 | Brave/Tavily/Serper API keys not configured | **HIGH** | Yes — Make It Mine pipeline needs search |
| 4 | Stripe payment isolation audit incomplete | **HIGH** | Yes — agent payment blocking needs verification |
| 5 | Evidence Locker has no local fallback | **MEDIUM** | No — works when UEF Gateway is available |
| 6 | Social feed pages return mock data | **LOW** | No — non-essential feature |
| 7 | Circuit Box UI has no Chicken Hawk backend | **HIGH** | Yes — control plane needs execution engine |
| 8 | Boomerang agent dispatch reliability | **MEDIUM** | No — fallback to local exists |
| 9 | Deploy pipeline has no execution backend | **CRITICAL** | Yes — depends on Chicken Hawk |
| 10 | n8n workflow deployment automation untested | **MEDIUM** | No — manual deployment works |
