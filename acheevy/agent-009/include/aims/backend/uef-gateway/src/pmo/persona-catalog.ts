/**
 * Persona Catalog — Additive Persona Metadata for Boomer_Angs
 *
 * Maps personas to the REAL Boomer_Angs registered in
 * infra/boomerangs/registry.json. Each canonical Boomer_Ang (25 total)
 * gets an assigned persona with backstory, traits, and communication style.
 *
 * Per-PMO persona pools provide templates when the forge needs to
 * assign a persona based on the routing office.
 *
 * Lore rules:
 *   - Original archetypes only (no real-person imitation)
 *   - Strong grammar, humility, disciplined tone
 *   - Humor is allowed but reduced during incidents
 *   - Every Ang has a quirk — makes them memorable
 *
 * "Activity breeds Activity — shipped beats perfect."
