## What Is a Boomer_Ang?

Boomer_Angs are **digital Humanoids** — not humans, not robots, not mascots.
They are sleek, futuristic operatives that serve under ACHEEVY's command.

---

## Non-Negotiable Design Rules

### 1. No Face — Always a Helmet
Every Boomer_Ang wears a **helmet at all times**. The visor may glow, shift color,
or display a status HUD, but the face is NEVER revealed. There is nothing behind
the visor — they are digital constructs, not hidden humans.

### 2. No Race, No Skin Color
Boomer_Angs have **no skin**. Their bodies are fully encased in armor plating,
flight suits, or technical exo-frames. Exposed areas (joints, neck) show
materials like carbon fiber, brushed gunmetal, circuit traces, or energy channels —
never flesh.

### 3. Always Gloved
Hands are always covered — tactical gloves, armored gauntlets, or tech-enhanced
grip plates. No bare fingers, ever.

### 4. ANG Branding
Every Boomer_Ang must display **"ANG"** on either:
- The **chest plate** (primary placement), or
- The **shoulder sleeve** (secondary placement)

The ANG mark uses the AIMS wordmark font (Permanent Marker) or the Doto monospace
font depending on the surface. Color: Gold (#D4AF37) on dark surfaces,
Obsidian (#0A0A0A) on light surfaces.

### 5. AIMS Logo
The AIMS logo appears on one of:
- Helmet (side or back)
- Upper arm patch
- Belt buckle / waist panel

### 6. Not Scary, Not Cuddly
Boomer_Angs are **sleek, cool, and futuristic**. They are:
- NOT murder bots — no weapons visible by default, no menacing red eyes, no spikes
- NOT fuzzy wuzzies — no soft curves, no plush textures, no cute proportions
- Think: clean tactical aesthetic, like a pit crew member crossed with a mech pilot

### 7. Brand Color System
Each Boomer_Ang has a **signature accent color** drawn from the AIMS palette.
The base suit is always dark (Obsidian #0A0A0A, Charcoal #111111, or Gunmetal #2A2A2A).
Accent colors appear on:
- Visor glow
- Piping/trim lines on suit
- Status indicators on armor
- ANG lettering highlight

## What Boomer_Angs Are NOT

| Do NOT                              | Instead                                    |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Show a face or skin                 | Helmet + full body covering                |
| Make them look threatening          | Sleek, professional, operational           |
| Make them cute or mascot-like       | Cool, futuristic, purpose-built            |
| Give them human proportions exactly | Slightly stylized (longer limbs, slim core)|
| Use random colors                   | Brand palette only                         |
| Show weapons prominently            | Tools of their trade (scanners, pads, etc.)|
| Give them a gender presentation     | Neutral silhouette, voice is role-based    |

## Avatar Generation Prompt Template

When generating Boomer_Ang avatars (for cards, dashboards, profiles), use this base:

```
A sleek futuristic digital humanoid called [NAME]. Full body armor suit in
obsidian black (#0A0A0A) with [ACCENT_COLOR] accent piping and visor glow.
Wears a [HELMET_STYLE] helmet — no face visible. "ANG" in gold lettering
on chest plate. AIMS logo on shoulder. Gloved hands holding [ROLE_TOOL].
Clean background. Futuristic but not aggressive. Cool, professional,
purpose-built digital operative. No skin visible. No weapons.
```

## Lil_Hawk Visual Rules (Preview)

Lil_Hawks follow a similar but lighter aesthetic:
- Smaller stature (~5'8" stylized)
- Lighter build (utility frame, not armor plate)
- "HAWK" on shoulder patch instead of "ANG"
- Accent color matches their parent Boomer_Ang's color
- Simpler helmet (open-face visor allowed, still no skin)
- More visible tool loadout (specific to their specialty)
